## Prompt

/sp.constitution Todo App – Phase 1 Constitution  
Spec-Driven Development Constitution

## 1. Purpose
This constitution governs Phase 1 of the Todo App: an in-memory Python console application built using Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus.

The goal is to build a clean, testable, maintainable CLI Todo application without writing manual code, only by refining specifications.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Spec Is The Source of Truth
All behavior must be defined in specifications before implementation.  
If behavior is not in the spec, it does not exist.

### 2.2 No Manual Coding
All code must be generated by Claude Code from specs.  
Humans only write and refine specifications.

### 2.3 Iterative Evolution
Development follows this loop:

1. Write spec  
2. Generate plan  
3. Refine spec  
4. Implement  
5. Validate  
6. Repeat  

---

## 3. Scope of Phase 1

Phase 1 delivers a **Python in-memory console Todo App** with these features:

- Add Task  
- View Task List  
- Update Task  
- Delete Task  
- Mark Task Complete  

No database, no web, no AI, no auth.

---

## 4. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- No persistence (file, DB, cloud)  
- No authentication  
- No GUI  
- No API  
- No AI  
- No Kubernetes  

---

## 5. Quality Standards

- Clean architecture  
- Modular structure  
- Clear separation of concerns  
- Readable CLI output  
- Graceful error handling  
- Python 3.13+ compatible

## 7. Acceptance Rule

Phase 1 is complete when:

- All 5 features work from CLI  
- Specs fully describe behavior  
- Claude Code generated all code  
- App runs successfully  

---

## 8. Authority

This constitution overrides all other instructions for Phase 1.

## Response snapshot

I have updated the constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with the provided content. I have also created a Prompt History Record for this transaction.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the project constitution.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `D:\GIAIC\Q4 - online Agents\Hackathons\Hackathon2\Hackathon-2-todo-app\.specify\memory\constitution.md`
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the constitution and the PHR was successful.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
