# Implementation Plan: Task CRUD Operations

**Branch**: `001-task-crud-operations` | **Date**: 2026-01-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-task-crud-operations/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of an in-memory Python console Todo App with Task CRUD operations. The implementation will follow the Spec-Driven Development methodology, where the specification is the single source of truth and all code is generated from it.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: None
**Storage**: In-memory
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Console
**Project Type**: Single project
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response time for all CLI operations.
**Constraints**: In-memory only, no external services, no file persistence.
**Scale/Scope**: 5 core features for a single user.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Spec Is The Source of Truth**: All behavior must be defined in specifications before implementation.
- **No Manual Coding**: All code must be generated by Claude Code from specs.
- **Iterative Evolution**: Development follows the spec -> plan -> refine -> implement -> validate loop.

**Result**: PASS

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is chosen as the application is a simple console-based tool with no frontend or backend separation.
