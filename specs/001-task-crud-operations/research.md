# Research: Task CRUD Operations

## Performance Goals

- **Decision**: Sub-second response time for all CLI operations.
- **Rationale**: For a simple console application, users expect immediate feedback. Sub-second response times will provide a smooth user experience.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as this is a standard expectation for this type of application.
