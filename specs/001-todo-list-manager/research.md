# Research Notes: Todo List Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-todo-list-manager`  
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Input**: No specific research questions or 'NEEDS CLARIFICATION' markers were identified in the `spec.md` or `plan.md` that require extensive external research for this initial phase. The core technology stack (Python 3.11+, local JSON for storage, console application) is well-defined and within standard practices.

## Summary

Given the simplicity and well-defined nature of the "Todo List Manager" feature and its technical constraints, no dedicated research phase was required. All technical decisions and approaches align with common patterns for console-based Python applications with local file persistence.

## Research Findings

N/A - No specific research was conducted as all requirements were clear.

## Decisions Made Without Research

All decisions were made based on the clear requirements in the feature specification and the project's constitution, favoring simplicity and standard Python practices.
