## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

I have created the implementation plan for the "Task CRUD Operations" feature.

- **Branch:** `001-task-crud-operations`
- **Plan File:** `specs/001-task-crud-operations/plan.md`
- **Generated Artifacts:**
  - `specs/001-task-crud-operations/research.md`
  - `specs/001-task-crud-operations/data-model.md`
  - `specs/001-task-crud-operations/contracts/README.md`
  - `specs/001-task-crud-operations/quickstart.md`
- **Agent Context:** The `GEMINI.md` file has been updated with the project's technical context.

The feature is now ready for the task creation phase.
