## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have generated the `tasks.md` file for the "Task CRUD Operations" feature.

- **Tasks File:** `specs/001-task-crud-operations/tasks.md`

The tasks are organized by user story and are ready for implementation.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the `tasks.md` file.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - "specs/001-task-crud-operations/tasks.md"
- 🔁 Next prompts: N/A
- 🧠 Reflection: The `/sp.tasks` command was executed successfully.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
