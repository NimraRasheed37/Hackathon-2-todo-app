## Prompt

now create folder for phase-2, and all activity I will share now will be of phase-2

## Response snapshot

Created the `phase-2/` directory at the project root. This folder will contain all phase-2 related work and artifacts. The directory has been successfully created using mkdir command.

## Outcome

- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for directory creation
- 📁 Files: Created phase-2/ directory
- 🔁 Next prompts: User will share phase-2 specific activities and requirements
- 🧠 Reflection: Simple organizational change to support phase-2 work segregation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A - organizational change only
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Await phase-2 requirements from user
